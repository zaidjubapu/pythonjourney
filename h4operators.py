'''operators in  python:
>>Arinthmatic operator
>>assignment operator
>>Comparision operator
>>Logical operator
>>Identity operator
>>Membership operator
>>Bitwise operator

Arithmatic operator:the operator which do calculation
+,_,*,/,**,//,%

Assignment operator:the operator which assign the value to an alphabets
=,+=,-=,*=,%=,//=,/=
x=20
print(x)
x+=1
print(x)
x/=3
print(x)
x//=3
print(x)

print(x)
x=5
x**=3

membership operato:not in, in
list=[1,3,4,5,]
print(3  not in list)
print(3 in list) # in and is different is that in should cotain with list or any other datatype
