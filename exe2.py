Problem Statement:
Harry potter has got n number of apples. Harry has some students among whom, he wants to distribute the apples. These n number of apples are provided to harry by his friends and he can request for few more or few less apples.

You need to print whether a number in range mn to mx is a divisor of n or not.

Input:
Take input n, mn and mx from the user

Output:
Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisor of n or not. If mn = mx, show that this is not a range and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number

Example:
If n is 20 and mn=2 and mx = 5

2 is a divisor of 20

3 is not a divisor of 20

â€¦

5 is a divisor of 20
